  Render is a declarative library for building efficient UIs on iOS inspired by React.

  * Declarative: Render uses a declarative API to define UI components. You simply describe the layout for your UI based on a set of inputs and the framework takes care of the rest (diff and reconciliation from virtual view hierarchy to the actual one under the hood).
  * Flexbox layout: Render includes the robust and battle-tested Facebook's Yoga as default layout engine.
  * Fine-grained recycling: Any component such as a text or image can be recycled and reused anywhere in the UI.
