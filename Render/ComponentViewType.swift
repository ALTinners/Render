/// The design pattern in Render is analogous to React.
/// The component is a function that takes data (ComponentStateType) and returns an immutable 
/// description of views.
/// Any view that is compliant to 'ComponentViewType' must take a 'state' as input and a optional 
/// configuration closure. 
/// When 'renderComponent' is called, the component should be rendered using the 'state' as input.
/// - Note: Any view can conform to 'ComponentViewType', not only 'ComponentView' and 'StaticComponentView' subclasses.

    /// This configuration closure is symmetrical to setting the 'props' in React.
    /// - Note: If your view is a custom 'ComponentViewType' class (Not inheriting from BaseComponentView)
    /// then you are expected to store this closure and run it when 'renderComponent' is called.

    /// (For example if the component is wrapped inside a cell, the parent view will be the CollectionView).
    /// Use this as reference for size calculation.

    /// size for this component.
