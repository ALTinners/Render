*React-inspired Swift library for writing UIKit UIs.*


#Why

- In render a view is a simple function of the application state inspired from React/Elm architectures.
- Diff and reconciliation from the virtual view hierarchy to the actual one under the hood.
- Battle tested flexbox layout engine ([Yoga](https://facebook.github.io/yoga/)) from Facebook (used in popular frameworks like React Native).

From [Why React matters](http://joshaber.github.io/2015/01/30/why-react-native-matters/):

>  [The framework] lets us write our UIs as pure function of their states.
> 
>  Right now we write UIs by poking at them, manually mutating their properties when something changes, adding and removing views, etc. This is fragile and error-prone. [...]
> 
> [The framework] lets us describe our entire UI for a given state, and then it does the hard work of figuring out what needs to change. It abstracts all the fragile, error-prone code out away from us. 

# Installation

## Carthage



To install Carthage, run (using Homebrew):

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

Then add the following line to your `Cartfile`:

```
github "alexdrone/Render" "master"    
```

## Manually
1. Download and drop ```/Render``` folder in your project.  
2. Congratulations!

To get the full benefits import `Render` wherever you import UIKit

``` swift
import UIKit
import Render
```

#TL;DR

**Render**'s building blocks are *Components* (described in the protocol `ComponentViewType`) and its layout engine is based on [Yoga](https://facebook.github.io/yoga/).

This is what a component looks like:


```swift

struct HelloWorldState: StateType {
  let name: String
}

class HelloWorldComponentView: ComponentView<HelloWorldState> {

  override func construct(state: HelloWorldState?, size: CGSize = CGSize.undefined) -> NodeType {
    let avatar =  Node<UIImageView> { (view, layout, size) in
      let radius: CGFloat = 64
      view.backgroundColor = Color.green
      view.layer.cornerRadius = radius
      layout.height = radius * 2
      layout.width = radius * 2
      layout.alignSelf = .center
    }
   
    let text = Node<UILabel> { (view, layout, size) in
      view.text = "Hello \(state?.name)"
      view.textAlignment = .center
      view.textColor = Color.green
      layout.margin = 16
    }
		
    let container = Node<UIImageView> { (view, layout, size) in
      view.backgroundColor = Color.black
      layout.width = min(size.width, size.height)
      layout.height = layout.width
      layout.justifyContent = .center
    }

    return container.addChildren([
      avatar,
      text
    ])
  }
}
...

let component = HelloWorldComponentView()
component.state = HelloWorldState(name: "Alex")
component.render(in: self.view.bounds.size)

```



The view description is defined by the `construct(state:size:)` method.

`Node<T>` is an abstraction around views of any sort that knows how to build, configure and layout the view when necessary.

Every time `render(in:options:)` is called, a new tree is constructed, compared to the existing tree and only the required changes to the actual view hierarchy are performed - *if you have a static view hierarchy, you might want pass the '.preventViewHierarchyDiff' option to skip this part of the rendering* . Also the `configure` closure passed as argument is re-applied to every view defined in the `construct()` method and the layout is re-computed based on the nodes' flexbox attributes. 

The component above would render to:

##Lightweight Integration with UIKit

*Components* are plain UIViews, so they can be used inside a vanilla view hierarchy with *autolayout* or *layoutSubviews*.
Similarly plain vanilla UIViews (UIKit components or custom ones) can be wrapped in a `Node`.


The framework doesn't force you to use the Component abstraction. You can use normal UIViews with autolayout inside a component or vice versa. This is probably one of the biggest difference from Facebook's `ComponentKit`.

##Performance & Thread Model

**Render**'s `render(in:options:)` function is performed on the main thread. Diff+Reconciliation+Layout+Configuration runs usually under 16ms for a component with a complex view hierarchy on a iPhone 4S, which makes it suitable for cells implementation (with a smooth scrolling).

##Hot Reload

You can use **Render** with [Injection](https://github.com/johnno1962/injectionforxcode) in order to have live refresh of your components.
Install the injection plugin, patch your project for injection and add this code inside your component class (or in your ViewController):

```swift

class MyComponentView: ComponentView<State> {
  ...
  func injected() {
  	self.render()
  }
}

```

##Components embedded in cells

You can wrap your components in `ComponentTableViewCell` or `ComponentCollectionViewCell` and use the classic dataSource/delegate pattern for you view controller.

##Use with ReSwift

[ReSwift](https://github.com/ReSwift/ReSwift) is a Redux-like implementation of the unidirectional data flow architecture in Swift. 

```swift

import Render
import ReSwift

class HelloWorldComponentView: ComponentView<AppState>, StoreSubscriber {

  override func construct(state: AppState?, size: CGSize = CGSize.undefined) -> NodeType {
    ...
  }
	
  func newState(state: AppState) {
    self.state = state
    self.render()
  }	
}

```

##Use with Buffer

[Buffer](https://github.com/alexdrone/Buffer) is a Î¼-framework for efficient array diffs, collection observation and data source implementation.
It exposes a declarative API for UITableView and UICollectionView.
This is an example of how to use Buffer with Render's ComponentViews.

```swift

import Buffer
import Render

class ViewController: UIViewController {

  let tableView =  TableView<FooModel>()

  lazy var elements: [AnyListItem<FooState>] = {
    return (0...100).map { _ in
      // AnyListItem wraps the data and the configuration for every row in the tableview.
      let item = AnyListItem(type: ComponentTableViewCell<FooState>.self, state: FooState(text: "Foo")) { cell, state in
        cell.mountComponentIfNecessary(FooComponentView())
        cell.state = state
        cell.render(in: self.tableView.bounds.size)
      }
    }
  }()

  override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
    self.view.addSubview(self.tableView)

    // Simply set the elements for the table view.
    self.tableView.elements = self.elements
  }
}

```
